## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of computer programming concepts.
- Familiarity with programming paradigms.
- Introduction to Java programming language.
- Knowledge of basic literals in Java.

## Introduction

An HTTP File Server acts as a remote file storage system, enabling users to manage their files from anywhere in the world with Internet access. In this project, you will embark on the journey of creating your own file server simulator. This simulator will allow you to save, retrieve, and delete files, replicating the functionality of a real file server.

## Basic Program Overview

At the heart of this project lies a simulated file storage system. Initially, the file server contains no files. You will use commands to interact with the file storage. The basic commands supported by your program are as follows:

1. `add NAME` - Adds a file with the specified name (e.g., `add file1`).
2. `get NAME` - Retrieves a file with the specified name (e.g., `get file2`).
3. `delete NAME` - Deletes a file with the specified name (e.g., `delete file3`).
4. `exit` - Terminates the program.


## Commands

- To add a file: `add NAME`
- To retrieve a file: `get NAME`
- To delete a file: `delete NAME`
- To exit the program: `exit`
